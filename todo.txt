TO DO

- Stat page
- better color coding by family
- sort by family
- translations
- make range selector more finetuned...user input rather than select?
- fix location
- change to https


- Stats ideas-   
--- top 10 largest trees for Lan and kommun
--- most common protected tree for Lan and by kommun
--- show on map and show list?

April 26 update (need to reveiw below also to check off)

use geojson filter when can instead of call to server  // tried this but had problems - need to come up with system of when to use the filter.   user may change to a larger filter for example back to Alla.
When : not changing to alla and prior hits are under 1000
check if prior results were over 1000 hits



-----
1. have start up map show top 500 trees of whole LÃ¤n
2. but with sidebar open
3. have sidebar close when search for trees if on mobile
- have event listeners on select to update other select by making call to API for data that .   For example, which trees are in kommun and which size range
- Make final call to update map with button click
- On button click make quick call to get count only.
- if count is over 1000, give message to user that over 1000 results, and to narrow request
or could just let them know that only showing first 1000

- feature ideas for sidebar :  stats.  MIN, max per kommun, most common trees types, largest tree types
families by tree

- add translation library
