TO DO
1. have start up map show top 500 trees of whole LÃ¤n
2. but with sidebar open
3. have sidebar close when search for trees if on mobile
- have event listeners on select to update other select by making call to API for data that .   For example, which trees are in kommun and which size range
- Make final call to update map with button click
- On button click make quick call to get count only.
- if count is over 1000, give message to user that over 1000 results, and to narrow request
or could just let them know that only showing first 1000

- feature ideas for sidebar :  stats.  MIN, max per kommun, most common trees types, largest tree types
families by tree

- add translation library
